# ClassRoom Management
<p>
  Created a 'Classroom management' website for my department. It shows routines, academic resources,
result, notices, and curriculum of different semesters. Teachers can add, edit, delete the resources and
students can view them. I have used Laravel 5.3, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, PHP and MYSQL database
here.
